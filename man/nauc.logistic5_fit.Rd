\description{
Evaluate the normalized area under the curve (AUC) and area above the curve
(AAC).

\details{
The 5-parameter logistic function \verb{f(x; theta)} is defined here as

\code{alpha + (beta - alpha) / (1 + nu * exp(-eta * (x - phi)))^(1 / nu)}

where \code{theta = c(alpha, beta, eta, phi, nu)}, \code{beta > alpha}, and \code{nu > 0}.

The area under the curve (AUC) is simply the integral of \verb{f(x; theta)}
between \code{lower_bound} and \code{upper_bound} with respect to \code{x}.

When the interval of integration is fixed, since the the curve ranges between
\code{alpha} and \code{beta}, the curve \verb{f(x; theta)} is contained into the rectangle
of height \code{beta - alpha} and width \code{upper_bound - lower_bound}. The maximum
area the curve can have is obviously
\code{(upper_bound - lower_bound) * (beta - alpha)}.

We first shift the curve by \code{alpha} to set the minimum to 0. We then
integrate the curve and define the normalized AUC (NAUC) by dividing its
value by the maximum area. As a consequence, the normalized area above the
curve is simply \code{NAAC = 1 - NAUC}.

Default values of \code{lower_bound} and \code{upper_bound} were chosen based on common
dose ranges used in the literature. They are also symmetric around zero
so that \code{NAUC} and \code{NAAC} are equal to \code{0.5} in the standard logistic model.
